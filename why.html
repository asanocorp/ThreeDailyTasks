		<p>The reason why I wrote this app is best explained with a story
			about myself.</p>
		<p>Like most people, I want to be fit an healthy. To achieve this,
			I sign up to my local gym. But it doesn't take long for the unknowns
			to start rattling around in my brain. How many reps and set should I
			do? Should I do cardio before or after resistance training? Should I
			be taking supplements? Is it best to work out in the morning or
			afternoon? Which exercises are best?</p>
		<p>All these unknowns start to weigh heavily in my mind. I begin
			to wonder if I am wasting my time. I skip a few sessions, and before
			I know it I haven't visited the gym in weeks.</p>
		<p>So many beneficial aspirations in my life have followed this
			path. I like the idea, I try it out, I get overwhelmed by the
			unknowns and eventually I give up.</p>
		<p>So I asked myself, what was it that I really wanted out of my
			gym membership? The answer is right there in the first sentence: to
			be fit and healthy. And I realize that I can achieve this goal
			without actually knowing the best ratio of sets to reps, the most
			effective exercises and without taking supplements. All I need to do
			is walk through the gym door. Simply being in the gym day after day
			and doing some sort of exercise achieves my goal of being fit and
			healthy.</p>
		<p>In a nutshell, my problem is that in seeking perfection I often
			end up with nothing. The solution was to convince myself that
			continuing to focus on these beneficial activities, even if I do them
			imperfectly, will eventually get me the result I am looking for.</p>
		<p>That is why I created Three Daily Things. It is a way to remind
			myself that any time I spent working on the three things that I feel
			would most improve my life is worthwhile.</p>
		<p>The app is deliberately simple. You list the three things that
			you feel would most improve your life, and when you spend any amount
			of time working on them, you give yourself a tick. The report allows
			you to quickly gauge how often to make time (any time) for these
			three tasks over the last week.</p>
		<p>For such a simple idea, my personal results were quite
			incredible. Prior to writing this app, I would estimate that I would
			have spent time on my three most important things maybe six or seven
			times a week, giving me a weekly score of around 30%. Using the app
			daily, my weekly score usually sits between 60% and 80%. That means I
			have easily doubled my focus on those three things that I know are
			improving my life.</p>
		<p>This started out as a personal motivational tool, but it has
			worked so well that I decided to make the web site free to everyone
			in the hopes that others would find Three Daily Things as simple and
			effective as I have.</p>
